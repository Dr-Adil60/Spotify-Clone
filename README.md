# ***Spotify Clone UI (Frontend)***

This project is a simple frontend-only clone of the Spotify interface, created using **pure HTML** and **CSS**. It replicates the design and layout of Spotify's interface but does not include any functionality, as it is only focused on the UI.

## ***Project Overview***

This project is intended to showcase the visual design and layout of Spotify's interface. It features the primary elements of the Spotify interface, such as:

- Navigation bar
- Playlist section
- Album art display
- Song list
- **Music Player Section:** A mock music player that resembles the one found in the Spotify interface. The player includes basic elements like:
    - **Play/Pause** button (non-functional)
    - **Progress bar**
    - **Next/Previous** track buttons (non-functional)
    - **Volume control** (non-functional)
  
While the buttons and links do not have any functionality (since this is a UI-only clone), the project demonstrates how to structure a web page using HTML and style it with CSS to match Spotify's aesthetic.

## ***Features***

- **Responsive Design for PC and Tablet:** The UI is designed to be responsive for **desktop** and **tablet** screen sizes.
- **Music Player Section:** The project features a music player layout, with a mock **Play/Pause** button, **track progress bar**, and **next/previous track buttons**.
- **Basic Layout:** The layout includes a top navigation bar, sidebar, and a central content area similar to the original Spotify app.
- **Styled Components:** CSS is used to style the page elements, including buttons, navigation links, headers, and more.

## ***Technologies Used***

- **HTML:** Used for structuring the content and defining the layout.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the layout, including positioning, colors, fonts, and responsiveness for PC and tablet.

## ***Installation***

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dr-Adil60/Spotify-Clone.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Spotify-Clone
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## ***Usage***

Since this is a frontend-only project, there are no interactive elements or functional buttons. It simply displays the Spotify UI with no dynamic features.

Feel free to inspect the code, modify the design, or add interactivity if you'd like to further enhance the project.
